## Formula SAE Brakes

Hydraulic brake system design for an electric formula car. Optimized for pedal force and thermal management.

## System Design

Dual-circuit hydraulic system with adjustable bias. 0.625" master cylinder. [https://placehold.co/400/450a0a/FFF?text=Front+Caliper, https://placehold.co/400/7c2d12/FFF?text=Rear+Caliper, https://placehold.co/400/9a3412/FFF?text=Bias+Bar]

## Thermal Analysis

CFD analysis of rotor cooling. Reduced peak endurance temperatures by 35% (max 580°C) compared to previous chassis.

## Performance

Testing at Canadian Tire Motorsport Park confirmed 1.2g deceleration. Stopping distance: 32.5m from 100km/h.
