## Payload Bay Design

Custom 1U payload compartment with electromagnetic shielding and active thermal control.

## Shielding

Aluminum honeycomb panels with 40dB attenuation at 2.4GHz. [https://placehold.co/400/1e3a8a/FFF?text=Panel+Layout, https://placehold.co/400/2563eb/FFF?text=Shield+Assembly] Validated via anechoic chamber testing.

## Mounting System

Iso-damper mounts (6 DOF, 15Hz natural frequency). Reduced payload vibration by 68% during launch simulation. [https://placehold.co/350/3b82f6/FFF?text=Mount+Detail, https://placehold.co/350/60a5fa/FFF?text=FEA+Results, https://placehold.co/350/93c5fd/FFF?text=Test+Setup]
