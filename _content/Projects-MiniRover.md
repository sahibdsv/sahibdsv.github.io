## Mini Rover

Designed and fabricated a rover with a 2-DOF arm. Built using Fusion 360, 3D printing, and MATLAB analysis.

## Fabrication

A complete design-build cycle. Gearbox modeling in <b>Fusion 360</b>, ratio calculations in <b>MATLAB</b>, and chassis manufacturing via additive manufacturing.

## Gearbox Design

Custom planetary gearbox (15:1 ratio, 8 Nm torque). [https://placehold.co/450/475569/FFF?text=Gearbox+Assembly, https://placehold.co/450/1e3a8a/FFF?text=Exploded+View] Sintered bronze bushings within a machined aluminum housing.

## Controls

Arduino PID control for arm positioning (±2mm accuracy). Ultrasonic array for autonomous obstacle avoidance. Validated over 200+ cycles.
