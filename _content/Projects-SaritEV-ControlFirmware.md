## Vehicle Control Unit

Embedded firmware for motor control, regenerative braking, and CAN bus integration.

## Architecture

STM32F4 microcontroller with dual-core processing. [https://placehold.co/400/0891b2/FFF?text=Block+Diagram, https://placehold.co/400/06b6d4/FFF?text=PCB+Layout] 1kHz control loop for FOC motor drive.

## Regen Braking

Captured 18% energy recovery during urban cycle. [https://placehold.co/350/22d3ee/FFF?text=Efficiency+Curve, https://placehold.co/350/67e8f9/FFF?text=Torque+Map] Blended with mechanical brakes via brake-by-wire system.
