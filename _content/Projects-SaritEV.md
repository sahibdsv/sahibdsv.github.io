## SARIT Micro-Mobility

Engineering support for the SARIT platform. Developing pedestrian detection, telemetry, and custom trailer systems.

## Scope

Mechanical Engineering Research Assistant. Focus areas: Trailer chassis design, LiDAR-based pedestrian detection, and vehicle telemetry. Official project: [https://saritmobility.com].

## Pedestrian Detection

Integrated LiDAR and computer vision for 15m range tracking (<200ms response). Deployed on Raspberry Pi 4 via custom PCB.

## Trailer Iteration

Refined design through 5 prototype stages. Achieved 23% weight reduction while maintaining 150kg load capacity. Final revision rated IP67. [https://placehold.co/300/dc2626/FFF?text=V3, https://placehold.co/300/16a34a/FFF?text=V4, https://placehold.co/300/0891b2/FFF?text=V5]

## Telemetry

Built a real-time dashboard for speed, battery, and GPS data. React-based with WebSocket streaming (50Hz updates, <5ms latency).
