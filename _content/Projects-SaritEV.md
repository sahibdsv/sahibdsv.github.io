.

## Pedestrian Detection

Integrated LiDAR and computer vision for 15m range tracking (<200ms response). Deployed on Raspberry Pi 4 via custom PCB.

## Trailer Iteration

Refined design through 5 prototype stages. Achieved 23% weight reduction while maintaining 150kg load capacity. Final revision rated IP67.
