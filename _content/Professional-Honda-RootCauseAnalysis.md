## Paint Defect Investigation

Fishbone analysis and DOE for orange peel reduction in e-coat process.

## Investigation

5-Why and Ishikawa diagram identified voltage inconsistency. [https://placehold.co/400/7c3aed/FFF?text=Fishbone+Diagram, https://placehold.co/400/9333ea/FFF?text=Pareto+Chart] Conducted 2³ factorial DOE on voltage, temperature, and flow rate.

## Solution

Optimized e-coat parameters: 285V, 32°C, 18 L/min. [https://placehold.co/350/a855f7/FFF?text=DOE+Results, https://placehold.co/350/c084fc/FFF?text=Before-After] Orange peel defects reduced by 58% over 3-month validation.
