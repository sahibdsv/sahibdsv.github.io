# The Natural Portfolio Guide

This is not a manual. This is a reference for a system that understands your intent. No codes, no tags, just your content.

## �️ Media: "Just Paste the Link"
The system is smart enough to know what you're showing. If you put a link on its own line:

- **3D Models**: `assets/models/robot.glb` → Instantly becomes an interactive 3D viewer.
- **YouTube**: `youtube.com/watch?v=...` → Becomes a performance-optimized player.
- **Video**: `assets/clip.mp4` → Autoplays as a high-fidelity loop.
- **Images**: `https://image.jpg` → Beautifully centered and framed.

## 🏗️ Layouts: "Write Naturally"

### **1. Action Buttons**
Want a button? Just name it and tell it where to go.
`View on GitHub | https://github.com/sahibdsv`

### **2. Showcase Grids**
To create a grid of items inside a page, just use a standard list with your data separated by pipes (`|`).
```text
- Robot Arm | assets/arm.glb | 3D Simulation | assets/thumb.jpg
- Web App   | https://site.com | React Portfolio | assets/web.jpg
```
*The engine sees the pipes inside a list and automatically builds a premium Bento grid.*

### **3. Galleries (Albums)**
To show a set of photos or models:
`Album: img1.jpg, img2.jpg, img3.jpg`
*Or just separate them with commas. The system handles the rest.*

## 📄 Professional Resume: "The Human Way"
Your resume shouldn't look like a database. It should look like a story.

- **Work History**: `Designer @ Apple` or `Engineer at Tesla`
- **Location**: Use the `@` symbol for maps: `@ Toronto (https://maps...)`
- **Dates**: Just write them: `Jan 2024 - Present`. The system aligns them perfectly for you.

---

## �️ Special Instructions
Sometimes you want to tell the site something secret.

- **Drafts**: Add `Draft` to your tags. It stays invisible until you're ready.
- **Featured**: Add `featured` to pin an item to your home page.
- **Search**: Press `/` and type what you're looking for. 
- **Internal Commands**: Type `clear cache` in search to refresh everything instantly.
